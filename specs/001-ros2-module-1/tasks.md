# Tasks: Module 1 - The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-ros2-module-1/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are NOT explicitly requested in the feature specification. This is a documentation/content project.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story. Each user story corresponds to a chapter in the Docusaurus book.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story?] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Docusaurus project**: `frontend_book/` at repository root
- **Documentation content**: `frontend_book/docs/`
- **Module 1 content**: `frontend_book/docs/module-1-ros2/`

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Phase 1 (Docusaurus must exist)
- **User Stories (Phase 3-5)**: All depend on Phase 2 (chapter files must exist)
  - US1, US2, US3 can proceed in parallel OR sequentially
  - For this documentation project, sequential P1 → P2 → P3 is recommended
- **Polish (Phase 6)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Phase 2 - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Phase 2 - Builds on US1 concepts but independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Phase 2 - Builds on US1/US2 concepts but independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- "What You'll Learn" → Main content sections → "Key Takeaways" → Navigation links
- Each chapter is independently completable
- Commit after each section or logical group

### Parallel Opportunities

- T003 and T004 (sidebar + GitHub Actions) can run in parallel
- T007, T008, T009 (chapter stubs) can run in parallel
- T041 and T042 (preview + validation) can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: Phase 2 Foundational

```bash
# These can run in parallel:
Task: "Create chapter file stubs with frontmatter in book/docs/module-1-ros2/01-introduction.md"
Task: "Create chapter file stubs with frontmatter in book/docs/module-1-ros2/02-communication.md"
Task: "Create chapter file stubs with frontmatter in book/docs/module-1-ros2/03-urdf.md"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (Docusaurus initialized)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (module structure created)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Chapter 1 written)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Verify Chapter 1 is readable and accurate
5. Build and preview locally

### Incremental Delivery

1. Setup + Foundational → Module 1 structure ready
2. Add User Story 1 (Chapter 1) → Test independently → MVP!
3. Add User Story 2 (Chapter 2) → Test independently
4. Add User Story 3 (Chapter 3) → Test independently
5. Each chapter adds value without breaking previous chapters

### Recommended Execution Order

1. T001 → T002 → (T003 ∥ T004)
2. T005 → T006 → (T007 ∥ T008 ∥ T009)
3. T010 → T011 → T012 → T013 → T014 → T015 → T016 → T017
4. T018 → T019 → T020 → T021 → T022 → T023 → T024 → T025 → T026
5. T027 → T028 → T029 → T030 → T031 → T032 → T033 → T034 → T035 → T036
6. T037 → T038 → T039 → T040 → (T041 ∥ T042)

## Summary

| Phase | Tasks | Parallel Tasks | Description |
|-------|-------|----------------|-------------|
| 1: Setup | 4 | 2 | Docusaurus initialization |
| 2: Foundational | 5 | 3 | Module structure |
| 3: US1 (P1) | 8 | 0 | Chapter 1: Introduction |
| 4: US2 (P2) | 9 | 0 | Chapter 2: Communication |
| 5: US3 (P3) | 10 | 0 | Chapter 3: URDF |
| 6: Polish | 6 | 2 | Validation |
| **Total** | **42** | **7** | |

**MVP Scope**: Phases 1-3 (17 tasks) → Chapter 1 complete and deployable

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story/chapter
- Each chapter is independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate chapter independently
- All code examples must be verified against ROS 2 Humble documentation
